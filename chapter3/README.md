[Using Python environments in VS Code ](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments)  
I use Microsoft's Visual Studio Code as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python and PowerShell. I had been creating virtual python environments int the terminal but the DevNet guide recommended doing it in VSCode.   

This article walks you through how to do it. The only thing I will add is that on the section ## Create a virtual environment it says:  
```
# macOS/Linux
# You may need to run sudo apt-get install python3-venv first
python3 -m venv .venv
``` 
DO THIS IN THE TERMINAL IN VSCode, not in your regular terminal.
