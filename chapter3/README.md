# Chapter 3 Introduction to Python

Chapter 3 is a great introduction to python. You will need to use additional resources to master this chapter but it gets you started.

## Useful Websites  
[Learning Python 3](https://mwhubbard.blogspot.com/2018/07/learning-python-3.html)  
This is my blog on Python resources. I update it on regular basis so bookmark it and check back weekly.  

[A curated list of Ultimate Python resources!](https://twitter.com/ayushi7rawat/status/1315651868891049984)  
This is a twiter thread. It contains a curated list of 
* books
* IDEs
* playgrounds
* podcasts hosting platforms for python projects
* youtube channels
* websites
* courses
* Technical Blogging Platforms where you can read python blogs  

[Beginner Python exercises](https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/03/12/06-string-lists.html)  
A practice site. This page is on string lists.  

[Real Python PEP8 Tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-pep8/)  
The cert guide has Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP8) as a Key Topic under the SDK section. This tutorial explains PEP8.  

[Your Guide to the Python print() Function](https://realpython.com/python-print/)  
Python 3.6 introduced f strings for printing. The cert guide doesn't use them, but they are way better when you are writing your own code. They eliminate the old %s and .format. This Tutorial is pretty good. 

[Python String Formatting](https://thepythonguru.com/python-string-formatting/)  
[Python String Format Cookbook](https://mkaz.blog/code/python-string-format-cookbook/#f-strings)  
These two sites do a great job of explaining string formatting. The Cookbook has a section on using f strings. F Strings were introduced in 3.6 and are much easier to use. I rewrote the print statement in the first python script to use f strings as an excercise. It's explained in the chapter 8 README. 


[Python's Built-in Functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html)  
There are a lot of built in functions in Python. This is the official python documentation on them. Normally, I find a function here and then Google it. I find the official docs hard to understand.
