Chapter 1 lays out why you should pursue the DevNet Associate certification. I will just say that automation isn't going away and if you stay in the field it's obvious that you are going to have to learn Python, Postman, and other tools of the developer.  

I earned my first Cisco CCNA in 2000. Back then there weren't many free or easily avaiable resources to help you out. But the times have changed! Cisco has built the DevNet program and offers hours of free videos, podcast, a GitHub repo, a reasonable priced ebook, print book combo that includes online flash cards and practice tests.

I can honestly say that it feels like Cisco sees the DevNEt program as key to their success in a changing landscape.

I recommend that you spend an hour and watch this video before you start - [DevNet Associate Essentials Series – Episode 1](https://www.cisco.com/c/m/en_us/training-events/events-webinars/devnet-associate-part1.html)  
I listened at 1.25 speed and it was completely understandable. In the past, I just bought the book and crammed until I felt comfortable with every topic. But this video describes a much more efficient approach.  

Here are the websites that I found useful why studying.

This is the place to go to find out what's on the exam. You can sign up for updates and I recommend you do. It's very disheartening to be taking the exam and thinking "Why is this on the exam".

Amazingly, on this page, they provide 10 free mini-courses. The first three are "Setting up your (Linux/Mac/Windows) workstation. I use Linux and Mac and I can say for sure that the guides are great. If you are new to Git, Python, REST APIs, you need to start here.  

UPDATE: Cisco released an Ubuntu image for the DevNet Expert course. There is no reason not to use it for the associate course. It's available as an OVA for VMWare Workstation and a QCOW2 for Linux.

This seems like the same as the first link but it is actually different. This breaks the topics down by weight and a verb.  

* Design --------------- Complete knowledge of the topic
* Troubleshoot --------- How do the parts fit together
* Configure/construct -- Deeper knowledge, how to do something
* Compare/Describe ---- Not very deep, just the concept.  

This link is a graphic from Cisco that shows the relative level of knowledge for each of those words. You should plan your study time around the pyramid.
