## Chapter 1 Introduction to Cisco DevNet Associate Certification 



Chapter 1 lays out why you should pursue the DevNet Associate certification. I will just say that automation isn't going away and if you stay in the field it's obvious that you are going to have to learn Python, Postman, and other tools of the developer. 

I earned my first Cisco CCNA in 2000. Back then there weren't many free or easily avaiable resources to help you out. But the times have changed! Cisco has built the DevNet program and offers hours of free videos, podcast, a GitHub repo, a reasonable priced ebook, print book combo that includes online flash cards and practice tests.

I can honestly say that it feels like Cisco sees the DevNEt program as key to there success in a changing landscape.

With that said, here are the websites that I found useful to get started.

## Useful Websites  

### Sites related to exam details  
[Cisco Certified DevNet Associate DEVASC 200-901
Official Cert Guide Companion Website](https://www.ciscopress.com/promotions/book-registration-cisco-certified-devnet-associate-142234)  
Information from Cisco Press about the book, flashcards, study guides, etc.  

[DevNet Associate Exam v1.0 (200-901)](https://developer.cisco.com/certification/exam-topic-associate/)
This is the place to go to find out what's on the exam. You can sign up for updates and I recommend you do. It's very disheartening to be taking the exam and thinking "Why is this on the exam".

Amazingly, on this page they provide 10 free mini courses. The first three are "Setting up your (Linux/Mac/Windows) workstation. I use Linux and Mac and I can say for sure that the guides are great. If you are new to Git, Python, REST APIs, you need to start here.  


[200-901 DEVASC Exam: DevNet Associate](https://learningnetwork.cisco.com/s/devnet-associate-exam-topics)  
This seems like the same as the first link but it is actually different. You can download the exam topics in PDF format.  

[DevNet Associate Essentials Webinar Series](https://mkto.cisco.com/devnet-associate-essentials.html?utm_campaign=devnetassociate-essentials20&utm_source=web&utm_medium=cln)

This is an interesting site. It really points out what I talked about above. There are 5 vidoes titled "How to study for any Cisco Automation Exam:Lesson 1 to Lesson 5". The total for all 5 videos is about an hour so it's not overwhelming.
