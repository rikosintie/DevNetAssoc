The packet pushers network has a blog for [Open Source Networking Projects](https://packetpushers.net/blog/open-source-networking-projects/). As you move along your NetDevOps journey this will be a good resource.

This is from Greg Ferro of the Packet Pushers podcasting network. I think it really applies to studying for the DevNet Associate exam.

Herewith is every self help book without having to read them all, plus a short note from me:

* Take one small step. (Small changes not a big change to start)
* Change your mental maps. (Change your outlook / mind / plan)
* Struggle is good. Scary is good. (Fear is part of the process, it’s normal)
* Instant judgment is bad. (Evaluate and re-evaluate)
* Remember the end of your life. (You are running out of time, every day)
* Be playful. (You have to be fun to be around to get fun)
* Be useful to others. (Then they can be grateful to you)
* Perfectionism = procrastination. (Good enough is near enough, perfect is the enemy of good enough)
* Sleep, exercise, eat, chill out. Repeat. (Work to live, don’t live to work)
*Write it all down. (Makes you think and re-think better)
* You can’t get it all from reading. (At some point, you must act or miss out)

That’s it. All the life advice you will ever need. In a blog post.
